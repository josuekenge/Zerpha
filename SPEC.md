1. Product Overview
Name: Zerpha
 Type: AI powered Vertical SaaS Market Intelligence Dashboard
Goal
 Given a user search like “CRM” or “logistics” or “home healthcare”, Zerpha:
Finds up to 5 relevant SaaS companies in that niche


Prefer vertical SaaS companies


If no clear vertical SaaS exists, general SaaS in that niche is acceptable


Scrapes and analyzes their websites


Extracts structured insights using Claude


Displays them in a dashboard similar in spirit to Apollo, but simpler


Lets the user export a slide deck style PDF for a chosen company using Gemini plus Google Slides


Target user: Analyst, tech lead, or M&A oriented engineer who wants a fast high level view of SaaS companies in a market.

2. Final Tech Stack
Frontend
React


TypeScript


Tailwind CSS


HTML and basic CSS, handled through Tailwind utility classes


The frontend talks only to your backend, never directly to AI APIs.

TypeScript


Database
Supabase (Postgres as managed DB, Supabase JS client in backend)


External APIs

ChatGPT API is optional, not required for MVP.

3. Main User Flow
User opens Zerpha


User types a query in the search bar, for example “CRM” or “logistics software”


Backend sends the query to Claude to find up to 5 relevant SaaS companies


First tries vertical SaaS


If not possible, general SaaS in that niche is accepted


For each company, backend:


Scrapes key pages using fetch


Sends combined text to Claude for structured extraction


Saves the extracted JSON in Supabase


Frontend receives a list of companies and displays them in a dashboard table


User clicks one company to open the detail panel


User can click “Export as slide deck PDF”


Backend uses the stored JSON, calls Gemini for slide content, then Google Slides and Drive APIs to generate and return a PDF


User downloads the PDF slide deck



4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Search and Company Discovery
Search bar accepts any string input


Example: “CRM”, “fleet management”, “home healthcare”


Backend sends a discovery request to Claude


Claude discovery behavior in backend:
Input: user query string plus a hidden instruction such as


“Return up to 5 relevant SaaS companies for this niche, prefer vertical SaaS, if none are available return general SaaS companies in this niche instead.”


Claude returns an array of JSON objects:


[
  {
    "name": "Example SaaS",
    "website": "https://example.com",
    "reason": "Vertical SaaS for home healthcare"
  }
]

Maximum companies: 5


4.2 Scraping
For each company website, scraperService will:


Use fetch to retrieve HTML for:


Homepage


Product or solutions page if link is easy to find


Pricing or how it works page if possible


Combine relevant text into a single string or chunked segments


Scraping depth: Medium


Timeouts:


10 seconds per page request


If a page fails or times out, skip that page and proceed with others


4.3 Structured Extraction with Claude
extractionService


Input: combined scraped text


Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet


Output: strict JSON using a fixed schema


JSON schema per company:
name


website


summary


product_offering


customer_segment


tech_stack


estimated_headcount


hq_location


pricing_model


strengths (list of strings)


risks (list)


opportunities (list)


acquisition_fit_score (number 0 to 10)


acquisition_fit_reason


top_competitors (list)


Additionally, for the entire search, a separate Claude call generates:
global_opportunities, a short text describing the top market opportunities in this vertical SaaS or SaaS niche


Reliability details:
Claude calls use try catch


If JSON is invalid, call Claude again asking only for corrected JSON


One retry only


If extraction fails, mark company status as “failed” and exclude from UI or show as failed


4.4 Dashboard UI
Layout style: Apollo vibes, but simpler and focused on your content.
Key components:
Top search bar


Text input


Search button


Global insights section


Shows global_opportunities for the niche


Generated by Claude


Companies table


Columns:


Name


Website


Short summary


Acquisition fit score


Row click selects company


Details panel for selected company


Name and website


Summary


Product offering


Customer segment


Tech stack


Strengths


Risks


Opportunities


Acquisition fit score and reason


Top competitors


Button: “Export as slide deck PDF”


No logos for MVP, you can add them later.
4.5 Export to Slide Deck PDF
Trigger: user clicks “Export as slide deck PDF” in the detail panel for a specific company


Backend uses reportService:


Steps:
Load company JSON from Supabase


Call Gemini 2.0 Pro with prompt:


Generate a slide deck structure and content for this company, including overview, product, customers, market position, strengths, risks, opportunities, and acquisition fit


Gemini returns structured slide data, for example:


deck_title


slides: list with title and bullet points


Call Google Slides API to:


Create a new slide deck using a simple template or base theme


Insert Gemini generated content into the slides


Call Google Drive or Slides export API to export the slide deck as a PDF


Save the PDF URL or file reference in Supabase reports table


Return the PDF URL to frontend for download


Export scope:
Export is per company, one at a time



5. Non Functional Requirements
Response time:


Total flow per search can take up to 3 minutes, with loading indicators


Companies processed:


Maximum 5 per search


Parallelism:


For simplicity and reliability, process 1 or 2 companies in parallel


Rate limit:


MVP, single user, no strict rate limit, but backend should handle one search at a time per client


Error handling:


If a company fails at any step, skip and mark failed


Never crash the whole search
